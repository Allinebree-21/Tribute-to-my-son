  <p>The day I heard your heart beat for the first time in the hospital I was ready to do anything for you. You come with a love that’s so strong and innocent, there’s no way to describe it. You are my greatest blessing, my joy, and my heart outside of my body. There is much to look forward to, to see you grow and to become a good person. I am proud of the steps you have taken though they are small. Being your mum I think is the best thing that has ever happened to me. No one can ever tell you how much I love you, don’t you ever forget that.</p>
